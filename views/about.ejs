            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Jose grew up in a humble family in the Philippines, where his father, worked 
                as a plumber to support their household. From a young age, Jose joined his 
                father on various plumbing jobs, learning the trade firsthand. Despite the 
                challenges they faced, Jose’s father taught him the importance of hard work 
                and dedication, which became the foundation for everything Jose would later achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                With his father’s unwavering support, Jose pursued a degree in mechanical engineering 
                and even became a professor. However, his connection to plumbing never faded. After 
                moving to Saskatoon, Jose decided to return to plumbing professionally, working with 
                several companies over the years and honing his craft.
            </p>
            <p>
                After gaining valuable experience, Jose founded Hotra Plumbing 4 years ago with the goal 
                of providing the Saskatoon community with reliable, high-quality plumbing services. 
                He named the company Hotra Plumbing, a tribute to the same name his father once carried as 
                a plumber, honoring the man who inspired him to reach for more.
